# Build a Responsive Web App Using Mendix Platform

## 1 Introduction
This how-to will teach you how to build a responsive web app using Mendix Platform for a hardware store. We have built this app using several key concepts of Mendix like UI widgets, domain model, microflows, and so on.

At a glance, you will know the tools available in the store and manage its details.

This how-to will teach you how to do the following:
* Create a web app for a hardware store  
* Build web pages to see the list of tools available in store, add tools with images, edit the tool details, and navigate from one page to another 
* Create a domain model to store tools information with image in database and render it on various pages
* Develop microflows to build a custom logic, add validation and confirmation messages 
  
## 2 Prerequisites
Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Download and install Mendix Studio Pro 10.0.0
* Have basic knowledge of Mendix Studio pro IDE, Mendix widgets, tools, and building blocks

## 3 Creating New Web App Using Template
To create a new web app from template, follow these steps:

1. Starting from Mendix Studio Pro, click Create New App:
 <p><img src="/Images/CreateNewApp.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
2. Search for the Blank Web App and click Use this starting point.

3. Name the app Hardware Store App and click the Create app button:
 <p><img src="/Images/AppSettings.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
4. The app gets initialized and the app will open on the app’s home page called Home_Web:
<p><img src="/Images/HomePage.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>

### 3.1 {Title of Sub-Section}

{Use sub-sections for more detail.}

## 4 Creating Domain Model
Now we will define the following entities and association in the Domain Model.
  * Tool- It holds tool information as follows:
    
    | **Attribute Name** | **Description** |
    |---|---|
    |Code| Autogenerated tool number|
    |Name| Tool Name|
    |Price| Tool Price|
    
  * ToolImage: It inherits from the system entity Image and does not require its own attributes. It holds tool image information.

### 4.1 Creating an Entity to Store the Tools
1. From App Explorer on left side pane, double-click **Domain Model**.
2. Drag a new Entity from the right side Toolbox and drop it into the domain model canvas.
3. Double-click the new entity to open its properties window.
4. Name the entity Tool and add the attributes:
 <p><img src="/Images/Tool_Entity.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
6. Click OK to close the entity’s properties window.
   
### 4.2 Creating an Entity to Store the Images
  1.  Drag a new Entity and drop it into the domain model canvas.
 <p><img src="/Images/ToolImage_EntityBefore.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
  
  2.  Name the entity **ToolImage**, then click **Select** next to **Generalization**.
  3.  From Select Entity window, Expand **System** and select **Image** : 
      <p><img src="/Images/ToolImage_SystemImageEntity.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>

4. Click OK to close the entity’s properties window.
### 4.3 Creating an association 

1. Create an association between the **ToolImage** and the **Tool** entities by drawing a line.
      <p><img src="/Images/ToolImage_Tool_Associatiom.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
2. Double-click the assocition link and select 1-1 association:
      <p><img src="/Images/ToolImage_Tool_Associatiom_Properties.png" alt="new app" border="2" /></p>
3. Click OK to close the association’s properties window.
        
## 5 Creating App's User Interface to Display Tools
Let's design a page which displays tools available in the hardware store.
  1. From App Explorer on left side pane, right-click **MyFirstModule** and select **Add Page**.
  2. From **Create Page**, select **List** > **List Columns** and click **OK**.
  3.                                                                                                                                                












 First, we will add Card Action to the Home page to navigate to the page which displays a list of hardware tools. 

1. Drag a **Card Action** building block and drop onto the **Home** page.
2. Double-click the **Card Title** and name this card **Tools**.

3. Double-click the action button to edit its properties.
4. From **Edit Action Button** window, select **Show Page** from Event On click  dropdown.
